# Animals
An articulated and interactive object in the shape of a flying animal using C and OpenGL

## Aim
Develop an articulated and interactive object in the shape of a flying animal using C and OpenGL. It includes: hierarchical modelling, model rendering, viewing transformations, lighting, interactivity and animation.

## Outcome
The outcome should be an interactive animated 3D articulated object, which can be shaded using three different sets of materials. The material set can be chosen using a popup menu attached to the left button of the mouse. The light source simulates sun light and the time of the day (noon, early evening or late evening) can be changed using a popup menu attached to the right button of the mouse. The object is constantly animated as if it was flying.

## How to run
The code is typically written on Mac, and it is convinent if you run it on OS X.
1. Create a new project in Xcode, and make a C file.
2. Copy the code to the .c file you created.
3. Run the Code
Note: you may need to change the Deployment Target from 10.12 to 10.8.
